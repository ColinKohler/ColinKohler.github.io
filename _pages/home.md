    excerpt: "The Helping Hands Lab develops perception, planning, and control algorithms for robotic
              manipulation in unstructured domains. We are particularly interested in robots with the 
              capability to assist humans in their native environments."

    title: "Visual-Force Learning"
    excerpt: "My research focuses on leverging both symmetry and visual-force information for robotic control. By exploiting the 
              symmetry inherent in both the visual and force information we can efficently learn complex manipulation policies on
              the robot hardware without the need to pretrain in simulation."
