I am a PhD student at the [Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at Northeastern University.
My research lives at the intersection of perception and planning/control for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.
I work in the areas of deep learning and reinforcement learning focusing on learning policies directly from sensor input to 
accomplish complex dexterious tasks. Other interests include stochastic models, simulation environments, model architectures,
and physical robotic systems.
