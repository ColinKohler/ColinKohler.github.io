I am a PhD student at the [Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at Northeastern University pursing 
my doctorate in Computer Science with a focus on robotics and AI.

My research lives at the intersection of perception and planning/control for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.
I work in the areas of deep learning and reinforcement learning focusing on learning policies directly from sensor input to 
accomplish complex dexterious tasks. Other interests include stochastic models, simulation environments, model architectures,
and physical robotic systems.
