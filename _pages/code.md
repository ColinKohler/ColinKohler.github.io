A collection of my more useful/interesting Github repositories.  
A complete collection of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ColinKohler).

Collection of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) modules/utils packaged for ease of use. Primarily used for rapid prototyping of new projects.
Added to iteratively as I find new and interesting PyTorch tips and tricks.
