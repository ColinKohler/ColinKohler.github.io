A collection of my more useful/interesting Github repositories.  
A complete collection of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ColinKohler).

## Helping Hand RL Envs
Various simulated robotics environments used for research in the [Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/).
Utilizes [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) for physics simulation. The focus of these domains is on a single robotic
arm armed with a parallel jaw gripper executing a series of manipulation based tasks. Work ongoing to release a more fleshed out version
of this package.

## Torch Utils
Collection of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) modules/utils packaged for ease of use. Primarily used for rapid prototyping of new projects.
Added to iteratively as I find new and interesting PyTorch tips and tricks.
