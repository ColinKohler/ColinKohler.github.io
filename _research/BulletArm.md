title: "BulletArm: An Open-Source Robotic Manipulation Benchmark and Learning Framework"
---
**Abstract:** We present BulletArm, a novel benchmark and learning-environment for robotic manipulation.
BulletArm is designed around two key principles: reproducibility and extensibility. We aim to encourage 
more direct comparisons between robotic learning methods by providing a set of standardized benchmark 
tasks in simulation alongside a collection of baseline algorithms. The framework consists of 31 different 
manipulation tasks of varying difficulty, ranging from simple reaching and picking tasks to more realistic 
tasks such as bin packing and pallet stacking. In addition to the provided tasks, BulletArm has been built 
to facilitate easy expansion and provides a suite of tools to assist users when adding new tasks to the 
framework. Moreover, we introduce a set of five benchmarks and evaluate them using a series of state-of-the-art
baseline algorithms. By including these algorithms as part of our framework, we hope to encourage users to
benchmark their work on any new tasks against these baselines.
